You should be able to add the audio app and web api files to a folder and open the solution to recreate both applications, as long as you have visual studios downloaded.
Then you have to setup MAMP with apache and mysql. 
I have set my database connection string inside of appsettings.json on the web api and I have set up the IP adress for my api in launch settings under applicationURL. 
You may need to install the extension Conveyor by Keyoti by going in the search by and searching manage extentions, then under the online tab search for Conveyor by Keyoti for VS 2022+.

This will allow up to four hours of use per day on a free account.
